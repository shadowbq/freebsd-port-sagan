Sagan uses a 'Snort like' engine and rules to analyze logs.

Sagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2) high performance, real-time log
analysis & correlation engine.  It is written in C and uses a
multi-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event
analysis.

The Sagan structure and Sagan rules work similarly to the
Sourcefire "Snort" IDS engine. This was intentionally done to maintain
compatibility with rule management software (oinkmaster/pulledpork/etc)
and allows Sagan to correlate log events with your Snort IDS/IPS
system. Since Sagan can write to Snort IDS/IPS databases via
unified2/barnyard2, it is compatible with all Snort "consoles".
For example, Sagan is compatible with Snorby [http://www.snorby.org],
Sguil [http://sguil.sourceforge.net], BASE, and the Prelude IDS
framework! (to name a few).
